     * `AccessControlList` (`@Protect(..., true)`) — `Mailbox` (the root) and `Folder` (whose ACL's `parentUid`
     * points at its owning mailbox's ACL, so a mailbox-wide grant flows down to every folder in it by default,
     * while a single folder — e.g. one Calendar — can still be shared independently on its own ACL, which is
     * what makes it possible to share just a calendar with someone without sharing the whole mailbox).
     *
     * Every other entity in this library is a "folder child" with no ACL of its own: `Message`,
     * `CalendarEvent`, `Task`, `Note`, `Contact`, `Attachment`, and `CalendarShareLink` all carry a denormalized
     * `folderUid` and are `@Protect(..., false)` — permissions on an individual message/event/etc. are never
     * granted or revoked independently of the folder it lives in, so giving each of them their own ACL document
     * would be both unnecessary (nothing ever differs per-record) and expensive at scale (one ACL document per
     * message vs. one per folder). `ContactList` has no folder to belong to and instead carries a denormalized
     * `mailboxUid`, checked directly against the mailbox's ACL. Every route for these folder/mailbox-scoped
     * entities checks `ACLUtils.hasPermission(user, record.folderUid | record.mailboxUid, action)` against the
     * owning folder's or mailbox's ACL (which `hasPermission` resolves by uid, following its own `parentUid`
     * chain), then performs the actual `RepoUtils` operation with `ignoreACL: true` since permission was
     * already established. See `BaseScopedChildRoute` for the shared implementation, and `BaseFolderRoute` for
     * `Folder`'s own hybrid pattern (real ACL, but `find`/`count`/`create` still need explicit mailbox-scoped
     * permission checks the same way, since a folder doesn't exist yet at create time and class-level `LIST` is
     * denied for privacy the same reason it is everywhere else in this library).
     *
     * `mailboxUid` itself remains on `Message` (redundant with its `Folder`'s own `mailboxUid`) purely as a
     * denormalized convenience for queries that scan a whole mailbox without caring about folder boundaries
     * (e.g. `MailboxQuotaRecalcJob`) — it plays no role in permission checks.
