/** Tags what a ROP-assigned integer handle (the `ServerObjectHandleTable` index space) refers to.
 * `entityUid` for a `"folder"` handle is one of `session.folderIds`' own value strings (`"virtual:<name>"` or
 * `"folder:<uid>"`), not a bare UID - the same format throughout avoids a second parallel encoding. A
 * `"table"` handle's `rows`/`columns`/`cursor` hold `RopGetHierarchyTable`/`RopSetColumns`/`RopQueryRows`
 * state for that specific table instance: `rows` is the resolved, order-fixed list of entity targets (same
 * `"virtual:<name>"`/`"folder:<uid>"` format) this table enumerates, `columns` the `RopSetColumns`-configured
 * property list, `cursor` how many rows `RopQueryRows` has already returned. A `"stream"` handle's `entityUid`
 * is the `"message:<uid>"` target its content was opened from, `propertyId`/`propertyType` the `PropertyTag`
 * `RopOpenStream` opened (this pragmatic subset only ever supports `PidTagBody`/`PtypString`, see
 * `MessageBodyStream.ts`), and `streamPosition` how many bytes `RopReadStream` has already returned (a
 * read-mode stream) or `writeTargetHandleIndex`/`writeBufferBase64` the accumulated write state (a write-mode
 * stream opened `ReadWrite`/`Create` against a `RopCreateMessage` draft's `PidTagBody` - see
 * `RopOpenStreamHandler`'s own doc comment).
 *
 * A `"message"` handle from `RopCreateMessage` (a draft not yet `RopSaveChangesMessage`d) has `entityUid: ""`
 * and instead carries `draftFolderUid` (the folder it will belong to) and `draftProperties` (the small,
 * well-known set of properties this pragmatic subset's `RopSetProperties` tracks - Subject/DisplayTo/
 * DisplayCc/DisplayBcc/an inline `PidTagBody`, each coerced to a plain string, keyed by decimal `PropertyId` -
 * a string key because a JSON-object key is always a string regardless of how it's written). `writeBufferBase64`
 * stores accumulated `RopWriteStream` bytes as base64 rather than a raw `Buffer` for the same reason `Date`
 * fields elsewhere in this class are stored as ISO strings: `RedisCache`'s Redis-backed path round-trips
 * everything through `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`, which cannot represent a `Buffer` (or a `bigint`, which is
 * why no property value is ever stored in its native decoded MAPI type here) losslessly. */
