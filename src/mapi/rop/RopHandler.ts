/**
 * Everything a `RopHandler` needs beyond the raw ROP bytes it decodes itself. `folderRepo`/`mailboxRepo` are
 * built once by `BaseMapiEmsmdbRoute` (not by each handler, unlike EAS's per-command repo pattern - MAPI's ROPs
 * are far more tightly interdependent around the same few entity types than EAS's per-command-collection-type
 * structure was, so centralizing the common repos here avoids every handler rebuilding its own). Untyped as
 * `RepoUtils<any>` rather than a generic `F extends Folder` parameter threaded through every handler file -
 * the same pragmatic `any` this codebase already uses throughout for `xxxClass`/`xxxRepo` DI fields, since
 * `RepoUtils<F>`'s method contravariance makes a generic version genuinely awkward for no real benefit here
 * (every handler only ever reads `Folder`-shaped rows, never constructs backend-specific entities itself).
 *
 * `folderClass`/`messageClass` (the concrete Mongo/SQL entity constructors) are threaded through here rather
 * than held as a field on each handler - unlike EAS's `EasCommandHandler`s, a single shared `RopHandler`
 * instance (e.g. `RopSubmitMessageHandler`) is reused for *both* the Mongo and SQL route (`ropHandlerClasses`
 * lists the exact same classes in `MapiEmsmdbRouteMongo`/`SQL`), so the concrete class can only ever be known
 * per-request, via this context - needed by `RopSubmitMessageHandler`'s `findOrCreateWellKnownFolder()`/
 * `messageRepo.create()` calls when persisting a submitted message's Sent Items copy. `scanPipeline`/
 * `mailTransport` back the same `scanAndRelay()` compose/send pipeline `BaseMessageRoute.send()`/EAS's
 * `ComposeMailCommand` already share via `MailSendUtils.ts`.
