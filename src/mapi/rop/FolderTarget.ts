 * Filters an already-fetched full folder list in application code rather than querying by
 * `parentFolderUid: undefined` directly - query-DSL semantics for "field is unset" aren't reliably consistent
 * across backends (the exact kind of gap this project's own testing philosophy has caught before, e.g. `$or`
 * being Mongo-only), so filtering a fetched array sidesteps the question entirely rather than risking it.
 * The comparison itself uses `== null` (matching both `null` and `undefined`), not `=== undefined` - a
 * top-level folder's unset `parentFolderUid` round-trips as genuine `undefined` from Mongo but as `null` from
 * a SQL `nullable` column, a real, previously-confirmed cross-backend discrepancy in this codebase (caught by
