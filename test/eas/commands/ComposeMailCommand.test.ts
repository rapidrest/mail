// Isolated unit tests for ComposeMailCommand's defensive guard clauses only - DI (via BaseEasRoute's own
// @Init) always populates every injected dependency before a real request can reach handle(), same rationale
// test/routes/BaseEasRoute.test.ts and test/eas/commands/FolderSyncCommand.test.ts already use for their own
// guard clauses. Every real SendMail/SmartForward/SmartReply behavior (relay, Sent Items persistence, Source
// resolution/threading, original-message flag flips, spam/transport rejection) is exercised via real HTTP+DB
// requests in test/routes/{mongo,sql}/EasRoute.test.ts.
